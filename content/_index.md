Hi there, and welcome!

I’ve always been drawn to how things connect — whether it’s radio signals reaching across continents, software development, or airplanes moving safely through the sky. This curiosity led me to a [career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipjonckers) in the air traffic control (ATC) and air traffic management (ATM), where technology and communication meet in complex, ever-evolving ways.

As an amateur radio operator since 1993 (callsign ON4FF), I enjoy the challenge and teamwork of radio sport contests, including events like the [CQ World Wide](https://cqww.com) and [CQ WPX](https://cqwpx.com).

[This site](/docs) is where I share a few of the projects, experiments, problem-solving adventures and ideas I’ve been working on — scroll down to explore some highlights.
