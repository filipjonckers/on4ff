## A Little Language Goes a Long Way on the Air

One of the quiet joys of amateur radio is the human connection that happens across borders, cultures, and time zones. Whether you’re enjoying a relaxed ragchew or exchanging rapid-fire reports in a contest, sprinkling in a few words from your contact’s native language can add warmth and goodwill to any QSO.

Using foreign language greetings is not about fluency—it’s about courtesy. A simple “Buon giorno” to an Italian station, “Bonjour” or “Merci” to a French operator, “Danke” to a German ham, or “Arigato” to a Japanese contact shows respect and interest in who they are, not just where they are. These small gestures often earn a smile on the other end of the microphone (or key) and can turn a routine contact into a memorable one.

In casual QSOs, these greetings are a natural icebreaker. Starting with “Buenos días” or ending with “73, gracias” often leads to friendlier conversations and sometimes even longer chats about culture, language, or life outside radio. Many operators appreciate the effort, even if the pronunciation isn’t perfect—intent matters more than accuracy.

During contests, exchanges are understandably brief and efficiency rules the day. Still, a quick “Thanks” followed by “Danke” or “Merci” at the end of an exchange doesn’t usually slow things down and can still convey camaraderie. Some contesters save foreign-language pleasantries for after the required exchange, especially when rates allow a moment of breathing room.

It’s also worth remembering that English remains the common language of amateur radio, and clarity should always come first. Use foreign greetings as a supplement, not a substitute, and avoid anything that could cause confusion—especially under weak-signal or pileup conditions.

Ultimately, amateur radio is about building bridges through radio waves. A single word in another language is a small bridge, but it carries a powerful message: I’m glad we connected. And that spirit, more than signal reports or serial numbers, is what keeps many of us coming back to the bands. 73!

## Common Greetings Heard Around the radio waves

You don’t need to be multilingual to make an international contact feel personal. Learning just two words—hello and thanks—covers most on-air situations. The table below lists common, friendly phrases for many of the most active ham radio countries.
