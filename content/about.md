Hi there, and welcome!

This site is where I share some of the projects, experiments, and problem-solving adventures I’ve worked on over the years.

I’ve always been fascinated by communications, aeronautics, and software engineering, and I’m lucky enough to work professionally in the air traffic management (ATM) world — right at the intersection of those interests.

Outside of work, I’m an amateur radio operator with the callsign ON4FF (formerly ON1AFN). I’ve been part of the ham radio community since 1993, and I especially enjoy getting involved in radio sports contesting in a multi-operator environment such as the CQ World Wide or the WPX Contests.
